# Pool-Detection
We have used and trained the yolo v3 based on DarkNet53 architecture to find bounding box around the swimming pools in satellite images and for segmentation we used open cv image processing techniques to clean the image.
We have used convert.py file to generate the bounding boxes labels for the given satellite images.
We have modified the last layer of architecture to make output class as pool only.
